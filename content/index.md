# Hello, World!
Hey, I'm Harry. I'm predominantly a reverse engineer with a heavy interest in Windows kernel exploitation.

## What am I up to?
- Currently I'm up to my neck in *Xbox One research* including:
    - Generalized kernel research
    - Investigating communication between VMs through *xvio.sys*
    - Documenting Xbox One kernel APIs
    - Kernel-mode code execution and mitigation research
    - Kernel dumping

## Cool Projects
- [Xbox One Kernel-mode Dumper](https://github.com/xitska/collateral-damage-hpayload/tree/kmodule-dumper) (and it's included import fixer)
